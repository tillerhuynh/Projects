##  Overview

This is a simple voice assistant project built using ElevenLabs' conversational AI tools. It's set up to act like a friendly personal assistant that can talk to you, help you remember your schedule, and make your day a little smoother.

What It Does

   - Talks to you in real-time using voice (not just text).

   - Knows your name (Tyler), its own name (Lebron), and your daily plans.

   - Starts a conversation with a friendly greeting and keeps track of what you say.

   - Can help with reminders, tasks, or anything else you throw at it in conversation.
